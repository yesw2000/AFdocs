**Note**:

1.  Quota and usage in the atlasgpfs01 Data area can be checked using the
    command `/usr/lpp/mmfs/bin/mmlsquota atlasgpfs01` but note that _the actual
    quota and usage is half the values displayed._
2.  In case the subdir `/pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/users/$USERNAME` does not exist,
    you can
    [request its creation from the BNL facility team](../getting_help.md#facility-specific-support).
3.  Additional space on BNLBox is available upon
    [request to the BNL facility team](../getting_help.md#facility-specific-support).
4.  And there is also a 9TB **scratch disk** `/usatlas/scratch/` shared among
    all users, where the files can be kept for **30 days**. Please make your own
    subdir `/usatlas/scratch/$USER` there.

### Guidance on storage usage

As a reminder, your home area ($HOME) is intended to store analysis code, and
not data.

Please use the other storage (`dCache`, `LOCALGROUPDISK`, and **Data area**) to
store data.

As for dCache, the files could be listed with the command `ls` under /pnfs.
However, they should be accessed via xrootd as explained
[below](#use-the-bnl-dcache-space). And for batch jobs, it is recommended to
write into the dCache at the job end.

## LOCALGROUPDISK

If you need to store data outside of the resources dedicated to the BNL Tier 3
(either due to needing more space, or to share data with colleagues who are not
using the BNL Tier 3), consider using LOCALGROUPDISK, which is a resource that
all US ATLAS collaborators have access to. You can check at
[RSE account usage](https://rucio-ui.cern.ch/r2d2/manage_quota) with the RSE
`BNL-OSG2_LOCALGROUPDISK` selected. Every user should have a **default quota of
50TB**, if you could not find your name there, please check if you have selected
`/atlas/usatlas` in
[the VO groups/roles](https://lcg-voms2.cern.ch:8443/voms/atlas/user/home.action).
For additional space if need beyond 50TB here is the
[Request form](https://atlas-lgdm.cern.ch/LocalDisk_Usage/USER/RequestFormUsage/)

### Dataset Replication to LOCALGROUPDISK

You can replicate datasets to the RSE `BNL-OSG2_LOCALGROUPDISK` in the 2
following ways:

1.  Make the request through
    [r2d2 request](https://rucio-ui.cern.ch/r2d2/manage_quota)
2.  Make the request using rucio command `rucio add-rule`. Please check the
    [rucio add-rule wiki page](https://rucio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/rucio.html#add-rule)
    for usage help.

## Use the BNL dCache space

**[dCache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCache)** is a system for storing and
retrieving huge amounts of data, distributed among a large number of
heterogeneous server nodes, under a single virtual filesystem tree with a
variety of standard access methods.

In order to use it efficiently, please do **NOT write output directly to /pnfs**
path (the dCache space), and also **avoid small files**. Instead you should use
the tool described below or Linux standard cp command. In the following
sub-sections, it describes the way to access and replicate datasets to this
system.

### Access to the datasets on BNL dCache

In addition to Rucio (and DQ2Client), a convenient python script
`/atlasgpfs01/usatlas/group/scripts/pnfs_ls.py` is provided to generate clist file (list of
physicsl file path) for files in given datasets on BNL dCache, including
datasets both on BNL rses (such as
**[BNL-OSG2_LOCALGROUPDISK](#localgroupdisk)**) mentioned above) and under BNL
users dCache area.

Please **click the following arrow** to see the full usage.

run `pnfs_ls.py -h` to get the full usage

```
% pnfs_ls.py -h
Usage:
     pnfs_ls.py [options] dsetListFile
  or
     pnfs_ls.py [options] dsetNamePattern[,dsetNamePattern2[,more namePatterns]]
  or
     pnfs_ls.py -o clistFilename /pnfs/FilePathPattern [morePaths]
  or
     pnfs_ls.py -p -o clistFilename [pnfsFilePath | pnfsDirPath] [morePaths]

  This script generates pfn (physical file name), pnfs-path,
or xrootd-path of files on BNL dcache for given datasets or files on PNFS,
where wildcard and symlink are supported in pnfsFilePath and pnfsDirPath

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v                    Verbose
  -V, --version         print my version
  -p, --privateFiles    List private non-dataset files on dCache
  -i, --incomplete      Use incomplete sites if complete not available
  -u, --usersDCache     Use datasets under users private dCache
  -l, --listOnly        list only matched datasets under users dCache, no pfn
                        output
  -o OUTPFNFILE, --outPfnFile=OUTPFNFILE
                        write pfn list into a file instead of printing to the
                        screen
  -d OUTPFNDIR, --dirForPfn=OUTPFNDIR
                        write pfn list into a directory with a file per
                        dataset
  -N, --usePNFS         using pNFS access, default is xrootd within BNL
  --useXRootdOutside    using xroot from outside BNL: access, default is
                        xrootd within BNL
  -L LOCALBNLSITE, --localBNLSite=LOCALBNLSITE
                        specify a BNL site, overriding the one chosen by the
                        script
```

### Access your data in your pNFS space

This section shows you how to access data in your pNFS space
(/pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/users/$USER/....)

BNL supports various interfaces to your area:

1\. `xrootd` (from interactive or any worker nodes) This might be the most
optimum way within your interactive or panda/condor jobs. All files are
accessible via xrootd by prepending the following

    root://dcgftp.usatlas.bnl.gov:1096/

For example:

    xrdcp -f root://dcgftp.usatlas.bnl.gov:1096//pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/users/hiroito/rucio/data10_7TeV/data10_7TeV.00167680.physics_MinBias.merge.AOD.r1774_p327_p333_tid206966_00/AOD.206966._000004.pool.root.1 /home/hiroito/abc.1
    [4.063GB/4.063GB][100%][==================================================][106.7MB/s]

Please notice that xrootd access would require a valid grid proxy.

2\. **NFS.4.1** (only from T3 machines - they are not available from BNL
production worker nodes.) Within T3 machines, files are accessible like normal
NFS file. Just use path.

3\. **Web** (from outside BNL) Using your browser, you can access your files via
browser with your valid certificate. just point to:
[https://dcgftp.usatlas.bnl.gov:443/pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/users/youraccount/xyz/]
(https://dcgftp.usatlas.bnl.gov:443/pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/users/youraccount/xyz/).

## Use the BNLBox

BNL provides a cloud storage **BNLBox**, similar to the CERNBox, but based on
**NextCloud**. You can use it to share between computers and mobile devices,
among groups. Everyone has a **default quota of 50GB**.

You can find
[more details on the SDCC page](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/services/using-bnlbox-cloud-storage)

It can be accessed from [web browsers](https://bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov), [or desktop
clients, or mobile apps] (https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients).

### Use the BNLBox on Web Browsers

The web browser URL is
**[https://bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov](https://bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov)**. You can log in
with your BNL account. Please find out the webDAV access URL by clicking on the
bottom left **Settings** on the sidebar, as shown below:

<img src="BNLBox-webDAV.jpg" width="211" alt="BNLBox-webDAV.jpg" />

The webDAV URL is something like
`https://bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov/remote.php/dav/files/BNL-User-8efba3ed-bfc8-4324-9cef-e9f4878c3c8d/`,
where the last part in the path is your unique UUID.

### Use the BNLBox on Linux machines

The software **[cadaver](http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/)** has been installed on
attsub machines at BNL, and lxplus machines at CERN. It is a command line webDAV
client, with ftp-like commands. To save you from typing the username/password
every time, you can prepare a file `.netrc` under $HOME directory with the
following content:

    machine bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov
      login yourLoginEmail
      password yourPassword

where you should put your own login and password. And run "chmod 600
$HOME/.netrc" to make this file visible only to yourself.

In addition, you can prepare another file `\~/.cadaverrc` with the following
line:

    open https://bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov/remote.php/dav/files/Your-LONG-UUID-for-BNLBox/

Please put your own long UUID here.

Then just simply run `cadaver`, it will connect to your BNLBox.

```

You can use davix commands (`davix-ls`, `davix-put` and `davix-get`) as well to
access to your BNLBox. These commands are available by default on lxplus. At
BNL, you need run "setupATLAS -q; lsetup davix" to set up the env. Then specify
the full webDAV to the davix commands plus an option `-k` (Disable SSL
credential checks).

`bnlbox.sdcc.bnl.gov`.
